        <p>Hi beautiful people, I’m Dyna and I’ll turn 15 in December. Talking about my name, it doesn’t mean anything in
          Khmer. It might be, but probably I don’t realize. In my country (Cambodia), it was named for both genders.
          Little did everyone knows, Dyna, is a combination name from my parents. My father’s name is Dyne (Dee-Neh) and
          my mother's name is Vanna (Van-Nah). Dyna (Dee-Na). The special reason that they named me this was to keep
          their name to be part of my soul and spirit forever. My parents are energetic, work hard and proactive. I started
          to see this world on December 18th, 2004. I inherit half of their names and I want to inherit their
          personality as well. “Dyna” keeps me to remember my special people who let me see this world forever. 
          To be honest, it is the most meaningful name that I’ve ever asked for. </p>
        <p>My favorite sport is frisbee. It is a non-contact team sport played with a flying disc (frisbee). It is unlike most sports due to its focus on
          self-officiating. This sport reflects players' intergrity by having an ownership to speak up and responsible for any calls during the tournament. My favorite animals are dogs, because they are very friendly and adorable, and snakes are my nightmare. They are super scary for me and I prefer not to see one, because I'm afraid that I would encounter the dangerous one</p>
        <p>Currently, I’m studying at Liger Leadership Academy, Phnom Penh, a place that is surrounded by nature. My favorite subject is depending on my mood, but generally, I would say English Literacy and Social Science. My parents would love to see me working as a personnel
          in the future, therefore it was my childhood dream job. However, as I grow, I’m thinking more about the world
          and my community need, therefore I would love to have a sustainable and inspiring project that could change
          one’s life.</p>
